# Flappy Bird Clone

## Description

Flappy Bird is a fast-paced, addictive arcade game where you control a little bird trying to fly through gaps between pipes without crashing. Tap the spacebar or click/tap on the screen to flap and stay airborne. Each pipe you pass successfully adds to your score. Challenge your reflexes and aim for the highest score!

## How to Play

- Press the **Spacebar** or click/tap anywhere on the game canvas to make the bird flap upwards.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or crashing on the ground.
- The bird falls due to gravity, so time your flaps carefully!
- The game speed increases slightly as you progress, making it more challenging.
- Try to survive as long as possible and beat your high score!

## Features

- Smooth physics with gravity and lift for realistic bird movement.
- Dynamic pipe generation with random heights.
- Collision detection between bird and pipes or ground.
- Score tracking to motivate players.
- Fun sound effects powered by Web Audio API (flap, point, crash).
- Responsive design with Bootstrap to work on desktop and mobile.
- Styled with CSS and Sass for clean, maintainable visuals.
